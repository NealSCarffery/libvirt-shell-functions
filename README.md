Description
===========

Shell functions (Zsh/Bash) to manage local virtual machines.

The following use-cases are supported:

* Easy virtual machine networking setup.
* Easy use of shared virtual machine templates.
* Easy creation of virtual machine instances.
* Easy data sharing between virtual machine instances and your workstation.
* Snapshot virtual machines and backup to remote storage.
* Exchange of virtual machines between co-workers.
* Managing of complex virtual machine clusters running on your workstation.
* Provisioning of virtual machines with configuration management tools like Chef.

We aim for very simple and lightweight code, and very transparent handling of external dependencies like KVM, LibVirt, Qemu, SSH, Rsync, SSHfs and Chef.
